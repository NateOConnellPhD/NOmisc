\title{Read Multiple Files from a Folder Quickly (as Data Frames)}
\usage{
read_all_files(folder, extension = ".csv", contains = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{Character. Path to the folder containing the files.}

\item{extension}{Character. File extension to match (e.g., \code{"csv"}, \code{"txt"}). Default is \code{".csv"}.}

\item{contains}{Optional character string. If provided, only files whose names contain this string will be read.}
}
\value{
A named list of data frames. Each element corresponds to a file, with names based on filenames (excluding extensions).
}
\description{
Efficiently reads all files from a specified folder that match a given file extension,
and optionally contain a specific substring in the filename. Uses \code{fread} from the
\code{data.table} package for speed, then converts each result to a standard \code{data.frame}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Read all CSV files in the "data" folder that contain "survey" in their names
survey_data <- read_files_from_folder("data", extension = "csv", contains = "survey")
}
